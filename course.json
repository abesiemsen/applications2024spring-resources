From another perspective, you'll discover a multitude of decisions you must make as a designer in order to accomplish the task. Among other things, you'll need to ask:</p><ul><li>Who are my stakeholders?</li><li>What are they trying to accomplish?</li><li>What do they already know?</li><li>What do they need to know?</li><li>What do they care about?</li><li>What constitutes success?</li></ul><p>This project is not about inventing something new, or making something beautiful. Rather, it is about recognizing and applying what's appropriate, and making something that <em>works well</em> for the people using it. The most successful solutions will likely be largely transparent to the user's conscious mind.</p><p>The final product of the project will be a clickable prototype that allows you to demonstrate your solution. It will <em>not</em> include the check-out process, nor parts of the site unrelated to the process of selecting a bicycle. It will not include any 'real' programming, or dynamic data. For instance, you should not attempt to make a 'search' feature actually search. It <em>will</em> include everything necessary to clearly <em>convey</em> how the interface will work. Therefore, a search button <em>should</em> take us to a view that looks like search results.</p>",

            "instructions" : "<p>With a partner, buy four different items, each at a different online store. (Don't check out, just get as far as the 'Add to Cart' button.) Before you start, pre-select items that are specific, that have some options (size, color, horse-power, capacity, etc.), and that represent a variety of needs and price-points. (An example list: a dark grey cable-knit sweater, a riding lawn mower, a two-line high-performance kite, a mid-range gaming laptop.) Make sure at least two items come from 'niche' stores, not big-box retailers. For each store and item, document the following:</p><ul><li>What UI elements did I <em>see</em> and/or <em>interact with</em> while <em>finding</em>, <em>comparing</em>, <em>selecting</em>, and <em>configuring</em> the specific product?</li><li>Have I seen this UI element before in other contexts?</li><li>Did I know what this element would do <em>before</em> I interacted with it? Why?</li><li>What general problem is this element designed to handle?</li><li>Why was it used in this context? Is it successful?</li></ul><p>Discuss with your partner as you go. Perhaps take turns being shopper and observer. Together, see if you can put names to things: 'Query field. Checkbox. Drop-down selector. Results list.' Don't limit yourself to just clickable things, also note the contextual affordances that help you understand what's happening: titles, labels, icons, etc. Make particular note of any confusion/mistakes/wrong turns you make. What misdirected you?</p><p>When you are done, summarize your findings:</p><ul><li>What elements or patterns seem universal?</li><li>Did I see anything that felt different or unusual?</li><li>What elements or patterns were specific to the store or product?</li><li>Were there any patterns or techniques that made one store stand out? Could the other stores have applied that technique successfully?</li><li>Finally, how did you feel when interacting with these sites? When were you happiest/most comfortable? When were you disrupted/confused/bothered?</li></ul><p>Feel free to trade/combine observation notes with your partner, but write your own concluding summaries. Structure your observations, notes, and summaries as an HTML document, then upload via Github, at the path shown below."

While we'll still concern ourselves with UI conventions and useful design patterns, we will also put more attention on innovation and creative problem solving.</p><p>We will divide the class into collaborative groups of three for this project. Each individual in a group will assume responsibility for a single user role. Put plainly, one of you will focus on player/parent needs perspectives, and ultimately design and implement features for that role. Another will focus on coach needs and perspectives, and the third will focus on the league administrator role. You woll work together with your groupmates to understand, ideate, plan, and coordinate responsibilities for features that 'cross' roles.

Could be pizza if you like, but could also be something like an airline ticket. The choice is yours... within some parameters:</p><ul><li>The item being configured must have a finite set of pre-defined options that can be clearly articulated and easily understood.</li><li>Completion of the user-experience should be possible in no more than 3&ndash;5 steps.</li><li>The item must be commonly understood, requiring only a minimum of 'education' in order to configure.</li><li>Abe must approve it. :)</li></ul><p>This project does not have a defined final deliverable, other than to say the finished product of your work should easily allow anybody to simulate the configuration process. You may choose to actually build and program the configurator in html/css/js, you may choose to build a clickable prototype, you may choose to only provide a series of mockups. You should, however, play to your strengths. Decide on a topic and a final deliverable that showcases your abilities, and maximizes the value of the time you spend.</p><p>What will I be looking for? Research. Clarity of problem/purpose. An understanding of your audience. Ease of use. Evidence of a strong work ethic. A self-sufficient end-product. Reasoned UX choices. Transparently usable and accessible UI. Ultimately, that it shows well!</p>",
